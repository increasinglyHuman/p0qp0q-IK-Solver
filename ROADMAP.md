# p0qp0q-IK-Solver Development Roadmap

## Vision

**The world's first truly universal IK solver** - works with any bone orientation, any scale, any rig.

## Long-Term Vision

### v1.x - Enhancements

- Multi-chain support (multiple IK targets)
- Pole targets (control knee/elbow direction)
- Iteration count optimization
- Convergence visualization
- Constraint presets library

### v2.x - Advanced Features

- Multi-creature support (tails, wings, tentacles)
- Facial IK (eyes, jaw)
- Physics integration
- Motion retargeting
- Real-time performance mode

### v3.x - Educational Ecosystem

- Interactive constraint editor
- Visual algorithm explanation
- Step-by-step tutorials
- Biomechanics lessons
- Community constraint sharing

---

## Success Metrics

### Technical

- Works with 100% of test rigs (Meshy, Mixamo, CC, TripoAI, custom)
- 60fps performance with 4 IK chains
- <20 iterations to convergence
- No mesh tearing or artifacts

### Adoption

- Integrated into Black Box Animator v2.0
- npm package with 100+ weekly downloads
- 3+ GitHub stars from industry pros
- Used in production by indie developers

### Educational

- 5+ tutorial videos created
- 1000+ page views on educational demos
- Community contributions (constraint presets)
- Referenced in animation courses

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk:** Swing-twist integration is complex
**Mitigation:** Math is already proven, just needs relocation

**Risk:** Performance issues with constraints
**Mitigation:** Profile and optimize, constraint caching

**Risk:** Edge cases break solver
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive test suite, graceful degradation

### Market Risks

**Risk:** Users don't need universal IK
**Mitigation:** Your Animator already needs it (multi-platform support)

**Risk:** Maintenance burden too high
**Mitigation:** CCDIKSolver is stable, rare updates needed

---

## Development Principles

### Keep It Simple

- Start with working code (CCDIKSolver)
- Make incremental changes
- Test each change thoroughly
- Don't over-engineer

### Make It Educational

- Clear code comments
- Visual debugging aids
- Educational examples
- Teaching-focused documentation

### Build for Real Use

- Integrate with Black Box Animator early
- Test with real models
- Listen to user feedback
- Iterate based on actual usage
