# p0qp0q IK Solver

**Enhanced Inverse Kinematics solver for Three.js with biomechanical constraints and multi-axis bone support**

## Overview

p0qp0q-IK-Solver (pronounced "pock-pock") is a modified version of Three.js CCDIKSolver enhanced with:

- **Swing-Twist Constraint System** - Biomechanically accurate joint limits
- **Multi-Axis Bone Support** - Works with any bone orientation (X, Y, or Z primary axis)
- **Scale-Aware Precision** - Handles tiny models (0.01 scale) and huge models equally well
- **Octahedral Bone Visualization** - Professional-grade bone display (like Maya/Blender)
- **Educational Features** - Visual constraint feedback and joint limit displays

## Based On

This solver is based on Three.js CCDIKSolver (MIT License)
- Original: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/jsm/animation/CCDIKSolver.js
- Copyright Â© 2010-2025 three.js authors
- Enhanced by Allen Partridge Â© 2025

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Swing-Twist Constraints (vs. Euler Constraints)

**Original CCDIKSolver**:
```javascript
rotationMin: new Vector3(0, 0, 0),
rotationMax: new Vector3(130, 0, 0)  // Hardcoded X-axis
```

**p0qp0q-IK-Solver**:
```javascript
constraints: {
  type: 'hinge',           // Anatomical joint type
  flexion: 130,            // Degrees
  extension: 0,
  wiggle: 5,               // Secondary axis freedom
  twistAxis: 'auto'        // Auto-detected from bone
}
```

### 2. Multi-Axis Support

Works with bones oriented along ANY axis:
- Meshy3D models (X-axis knees)
- Mixamo models (Y-axis knees)
- Character Creator (Z-axis or inverted axes)
- Custom rigs (any orientation)

**Auto-detects** bone orientation and applies constraints to the correct axis.

### 3. Octahedral Bone Visualization

Professional bone display system:
- Directional octahedral bones (show bone orientation)
- Joint spheres at connections
- Constraint arcs showing valid ranges
- Color-coded by bone type (red=hinge, blue=ball, green=universal)

## Installation

```bash
npm install p0qp0q-ik-solver
```

Or use directly:
```javascript
import { P0qP0qIKSolver } from './p0qp0q-IK-Solver.js';
```

## Usage

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three';
import { P0qP0qIKSolver } from 'p0qp0q-ik-solver';

// Define IK chains with auto-detected constraints
const iks = [
  {
    target: targetBoneIndex,
    effector: effectorBoneIndex,
    links: [
      {
        index: hipBoneIndex,
        constraints: { type: 'ball', range: 90 }
      },
      {
        index: kneeBoneIndex,
        constraints: { type: 'hinge', flexion: 130, wiggle: 5 }
        // twistAxis auto-detected from bone orientation!
      },
      {
        index: ankleBoneIndex,
        constraints: { type: 'universal', range: 45 }
      }
    ]
  }
];

// Create solver
const ikSolver = new P0qP0qIKSolver(skinnedMesh, iks);

// Update in animation loop
ikSolver.update();
```
